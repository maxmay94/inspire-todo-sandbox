# Inspire Example Project Starter Pack

Welcome to our interview proecess. The goal if this project is to get some insight to see how well we can work together in a way that most resembles "real work."

## Instructions

First fork this sandbox.

PLease use the API endpoint provided to build a small "to-do" app. List the todos, create a todo, complete, delete, edit todos.

You can find the guide to using the json-placeholder data here: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/

## About

This project isn't supposed to be a brain teaser. Please take a look beforehand, feel free to fork this project, play around, even download it locally.

- Use whatever editor you want. If you're more comfortable in VS code, we can do that!
- Use whatever styling you want. I have tailwind here, but feel free to use bootstrap, regular css, emotion, whatever
- Feel free to install whatever extra packages you're most comfortable with!

## Fake API

Don't want to do to-do's? There's actually a variety of resources in json-placeholder, so build whatever you think shows off your skills!
